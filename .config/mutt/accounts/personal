# Mailboxes to show in the sidebar
#	NOTE: Gmail doesn't support folders, only labels. Therefore the
#	idea of nested folders doesn't really fly. All of the 'nested
#	labels' I set up on Gmail are actually not nested at all. Label1
#	and Label1.Label2 are separate. To have the sidebar handle them as
#	being nested, just create symlinks in the main Label directory:
#		cd .mail/<email>/Mailing\ List
#		ln -s ../Mailing\ List.Github Github
